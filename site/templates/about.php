         <h2>Background</h2>
         <p>Introduction: Soodie was born in Abadan, Iran, and immigrated to the US at the age of 17. 
After getting married I resided in the Bay Area and started taking classes at Diablo Valley College 
with majoring in architecture. I paused my education for couple of decades to raise my kids and 
start a career in telecommunication. Last year, fall of 2019, I decided to go back to college and 
continue my academic education.</p>
